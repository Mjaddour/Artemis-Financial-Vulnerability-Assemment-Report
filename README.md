# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assemment-Report

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is committed to updating their operating system and implementing the latest and most effective software security measures. In pursuit of this goal, we thoroughly analyzed potential software vulnerabilities, produced a detailed report, and established a secure software system for the company.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Following the assessment, the application showed a few vulnerabilities. It was imperative to pinpoint these vulnerabilities, underlining the significance of maintaining secure code. This not only shields customer data but also established confidence in customers, a critical factor in the financial industry where trust is paramount.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Because it was the first time, reading and identifying the vulnerabilities in the assessment was a challenging task.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Since the project focused on assessment identification, the mitigation plan involved addressing SQL injections, improving connection security, implementing secure coding practices, and conducting routine security assessments.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure code and software application functionality and security, we conducted code reviews and comprehensive testing. We adhered to best practices, and security testing to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments were also implemented for ongoing protection.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

In this project, I utilized Maven, which is an excellent build and project management tool for Java applications. Maven streamlines project setup and dependency management, making it easier to manage and build complex Java projects. This tool can be highly valuable in future assignments or tasks, as it enhances project organization, automates build processes, and simplifies dependency management.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I can provide future employers with a visible example of a vulnerability check using Maven. This showcases my skills in utilizing Maven for security testing, emphasizing my ability to integrate tools and practices to ensure software security. Demonstrating a practical application of secure coding practices and vulnerability management can serve as valuable evidence of my expertise in securing software applications
